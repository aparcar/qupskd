# quPSKd - QKD to PSK

> [!CAUTION]
> This document describes a proof-of-concept for demonstration purposes only.

This Key Management System (KMS) interfaces with (simulated) quantum key
distribution (QKD) endpoints as specified in [ETSI 014]. The primary function of
the KMS is to request keys from the QKD API and instruct the corresponding party
on which key ID to utilize.

> Quantum key distribution employs (entangled) quantum particles to generate key
> material through a fiber optic cable, making it physically impossible
> (citation needed) for eavesdropping on the quantum exchange. An attacker may
> only disrupt the exchange of key material, as photons can be "read" only once.

Upon every key change, _qupskd_ combines both keys, concatenates them, and applies
SHA3 hashing. The resultant hash is saved on both devices and serves as a
pre-shared key (PSK). Downstream applications can then utilize this key for
encryption and authentification purposes.

## Exchange Sequence

The diagram below outlines the key exchange process initiated by Alice. A
similar procedure is followed for Bob.

    participant QKD Device Alice
    Note over Alice: Request key_ID
    Alice->>Bob: /new
    Note over Bob: Request new key
    Bob->>QKD Device Bob: /api/v1/keys/sae_alice/enc_keys
    QKD Device Bob -->> Bob: { "key_ID": "ABC...", "key": "123..."}
    Note over Bob: Return key_ID
    Bob-->>Alice: { "key_ID": "ABC..."}
    Note over Alice: Request key with key_ID
    Alice->>QKD Device Alice: /api/v1/keys/sae_bob/dec_keys?key_ID=ABC...
    QKD Device Alice -->> Alice: { "key_ID": "ABC...", "key": "123..."}
    Alice ->> Bob: /ack
    Note over Alice,Bob: Write key
    loop Every 120 seconds
        Alice->>Bob: /rotate
        Bob->>QKD Device Bob: /api/v1/keys/sae_alice/enc_keys
        QKD Device Bob -->> Bob: { "key_ID": "ABC...", "key": "123..."}
        Bob-->>Alice: { "key_ID": "ABC..."}
        Alice->>QKD Device Alice: /api/v1/keys/sae_bob/dec_keys?key_ID=ABC...
        QKD Device Alice -->> Alice: { "key_ID": "ABC...", "key": "123..."}
        Alice ->> Bob: /ack
        Note over Alice,Bob: Write key
    end
```

1. Alice contacts Bob's API endpoint `/new` to obtain a `key_ID`.
2. Bob seeks a new key from his QKD device using the `/enc_keys` endpoint.
3. Bob's QKD device provides a fresh key and must then remove it from its storage.
4. Bob shares the `key_ID` with Alice as a response of the `/new` request.
5. Alice requests the specific key associated with the `key_ID` from her QKD device.
6. Alice's QKD device delivers the requested key and removes it from its storage.
7. Alices contacts Bob's API endpoint `/ack` to signal the key was found.
   **A new PSK is generated**.

The steps outlined are repeated every two minutes, except the `/rotate`
endpoint is used now, as both key management systems already have keys
from both entities.

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through a [TOML] file, located either at
`/etc/qupskd.toml` or a path specified by the `QUPSKD_CONFIG_FILE` environment
variable. The options within are explained inline of the example configuration
at [qupskd_alice.toml](./example/qupskd_alice.toml).

> [!TIP]
> Some configurations (`remote_KME_ID`, etc.) may seem
> unfamiliar and are specifically relevant when integrating real QKD devices.
> For a simulated QKD device, it is essential to use identical identifiers on
> both ends, as demonstrated in `./example`.

## Demonstration

If you don't have a real QKD setup, you can simulate one using the provided
`qkd_simulator.py`. This script will behave as a QKD device, providing keys via
an ETSI 014 REST API. Start it with the following command:

```shell
./qkd_simulator.py localhost 12345
```

Execute `qupskd.py` using the three configuration files located in `./example`.

```shell
# shell 1
QUPSKD_CONFIG_FILE=example/qupskd_alice.toml ./qupskd.py

# shell 2
QUPSKD_CONFIG_FILE=example/qupskd_bob.toml ./qupskd.py
```

Shortly, you should observe the creation of the following files, which contain
identical keys in different locations. In a more complex demonstration, this
setup would operate across various devices, synchronizing over a local network.

- `./pks/alice/bob.key` <-> `./pks/bob/alice.key`

Upon successful key exchange, a downstream application like [WireGuard] could
leverage these keys. Imagine configuring a `cronjob` to automatically update a
WireGuard connection with the exchanged keys as PSK.

> [!WARNING]
> quPSKd does not manage sessions, and there may be brief intervals where the
> keys differ. [WireGuard] incorporates its own session management and
> handshake mechanisms. Your downstream application should also address these
> aspects.

```shell
# on a device connected to bob
* * * * * wg set wg1 peer XYZ...ABC= preshared-key ./pks/bob/alice.key
```

## Using `wg-set-psk`

Instead of storing secret keys in files, you can use the `wg-set-psk` command
to directly inject the key into a WireGuard interface. This command needs to
be manually compiled and installed from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aparcar/wg-set-psk).

Whichever WireGuard peer has the `wireguard_public_key` attribute will
automatically be updated on every key rotation.

## PSK generation

The resulting PSK is not the plain QKD key but instead a combination of the
previous PSK, the new QKD key, and the key ID. This process is repeated for
every key exchange. The following pseudo-code illustrates the process:

```
k <- KDF("quPSKd Version 1", PSK)
while True:
    key_id <- qkd_key_id()
    qkd_key <- qkd_get_key(key_id)
    (k, osk) <- KDF(k || qkd_key || key_id)
    transmit_qkd_metadata(qkd_key)
    wireguard.set_psk(osk)
```

## Why quPSKd?

Quantum computers pose a significant threat to conventional key exchange
mechanisms and public-key cryptography (citation needed). QKD aims to counter
this by enabling the continuous refresh of pre-shared keys at two locations,
facilitating secure encryption.

This software merely serves as a bridge, orchestrating the transfer of key
material provided by simulated QKD devices for subsequent use.

## What's Next

Remember, this is just a demonstration created within a limited time frame.
Neither the proposed _protocol_ nor its implementation is intended for actual
use cases. Future iterations could evolve this concept into a practical
application, but currently, it showcases the feasibility of a working system.

## Alternatives

Currently, _quPSKd_ is intended for demonstration purposes only. If you're seeking
genuine security measures against quantum computing threats, consider exploring
[Rosenpass] which uses post-quantum cryptography instead. It offers protection for
[WireGuard] connections or generates a key file in a manner similar to _quPSKd_.
